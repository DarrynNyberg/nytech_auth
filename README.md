# nytech_auth
Headless Drupal authentication module.

## This module provides endpoints and functions to be used with any Drupal 7 website. it does not need any other Drupal rest modules. This module and the other "nytech_*" modules are being created to get arround the use of the more "standard" Drupal modules.

## How to use
sent base 64 encoded header to api/v1/auth to authenticate the user. No need to store the user and pass, simply store the returned session id (sid) and use the sid to authenticate on every other call you make. 

Send sid with a header of NYTECHSID to any endpoint to confirm the user authenticated.

Log your user out with a get call to api/v1/logout/<sid> (SID's are strings generated by the Drupal website).
